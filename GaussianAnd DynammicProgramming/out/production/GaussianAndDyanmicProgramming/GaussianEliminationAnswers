Problem 1:
    The reason that the forwardelimination algorithm fails to provide a solution to the system of equations:
        x + y + z = 6
        x + y + 2z = 9
        x + 2y + 3z = 14
    is because the algorithm fails if/when there are any zeros in the diagonal, otherwise known as a singular matrix.
    Therefore, When doing the elimination, as soon as the first loop of the algorithm executes, it will become unsolvable by itself because A[i][i] == 0. This is stated in the textbook also, and suggests that the necessary change is to sap rows so that this is avoided.


    Problems 2:
        The algorithm fails to solve the system:
         x + y + z = 6
         x + y + 2z = 9
         2x + 2y + 3x = 15
         because it has an infinite number of solutions. Doing a simple row operation shows this since: R2 - R1 gives:
            x + y + z = 6
            0 + 0 + z = 3
            2x + 2y + 3x = 15
        meaning that there are an infinite number of solutions for the system. The algorithm in the book will result in a NaN error because it will try to divide by zero since there will be no non-zero coefficients in the row.
